# SPEK Command Reference

**SPEK** (Get Shit Done) creates hierarchical project plans optimized for solo agentic development with Claude Code.

## Quick Start

1. `/spek:new-project` - Initialize project (includes research, requirements, roadmap)
2. `/spek:plan-phase 1` - Create detailed plan for first phase
3. `/spek:execute-phase 1` - Execute the phase

## Staying Updated

SPEK evolves fast. Update periodically:

```bash
npx spek-cc@latest
```

## Core Workflow

```
/spek:new-project → /spek:plan-phase → /spek:execute-phase → repeat
```

### Project Initialization

**`/spek:new-project`**
Initialize new project through unified flow.

One command takes you from idea to ready-for-planning:
- Deep questioning to understand what you're building
- Optional domain research (spawns 4 parallel researcher agents)
- Requirements definition with v1/v2/out-of-scope scoping
- Roadmap creation with phase breakdown and success criteria

Creates all `.planning/` artifacts:
- `PROJECT.md` — vision and requirements
- `config.json` — workflow mode (interactive/yolo)
- `research/` — domain research (if selected)
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements with REQ-IDs
- `ROADMAP.md` — phases mapped to requirements
- `STATE.md` — project memory

Usage: `/spek:new-project`

**`/spek:map-codebase`**
Map an existing codebase for brownfield projects.

- Analyzes codebase with parallel Explore agents
- Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 focused documents
- Covers stack, architecture, structure, conventions, testing, integrations, concerns
- Use before `/spek:new-project` on existing codebases

Usage: `/spek:map-codebase`

### Phase Planning

**`/spek:discuss-phase <number>`**
Help articulate your vision for a phase before planning.

- Captures how you imagine this phase working
- Creates CONTEXT.md with your vision, essentials, and boundaries
- Use when you have ideas about how something should look/feel

Usage: `/spek:discuss-phase 2`

**`/spek:research-phase <number>`**
Comprehensive ecosystem research for niche/complex domains.

- Discovers standard stack, architecture patterns, pitfalls
- Creates RESEARCH.md with "how experts build this" knowledge
- Use for 3D, games, audio, shaders, ML, and other specialized domains
- Goes beyond "which library" to ecosystem knowledge

Usage: `/spek:research-phase 3`

**`/spek:list-phase-assumptions <number>`**
See what Claude is planning to do before it starts.

- Shows Claude's intended approach for a phase
- Lets you course-correct if Claude misunderstood your vision
- No files created - conversational output only

Usage: `/spek:list-phase-assumptions 3`

**`/spek:plan-phase <number>`**
Create detailed execution plan for a specific phase.

- Generates `.planning/phases/XX-phase-name/XX-YY-PLAN.md`
- Breaks phase into concrete, actionable tasks
- Includes verification criteria and success measures
- Multiple plans per phase supported (XX-01, XX-02, etc.)

Usage: `/spek:plan-phase 1`
Result: Creates `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

### Execution

**`/spek:execute-phase <phase-number>`**
Execute all plans in a phase.

- Groups plans by wave (from frontmatter), executes waves sequentially
- Plans within each wave run in parallel via Task tool
- Verifies phase goal after all plans complete
- Updates REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md

Usage: `/spek:execute-phase 5`

### Quick Mode

**`/spek:quick`**
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with SPEK guarantees but skip optional agents.

Quick mode uses the same system with a shorter path:
- Spawns planner + executor (skips researcher, checker, verifier)
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases
- Updates STATE.md tracking (not ROADMAP.md)

Use when you know exactly what to do and the task is small enough to not need research or verification.

Usage: `/spek:quick`
Result: Creates `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/PLAN.md`, `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/SUMMARY.md`

### Roadmap Management

**`/spek:add-phase <description>`**
Add new phase to end of current milestone.

- Appends to ROADMAP.md
- Uses next sequential number
- Updates phase directory structure

Usage: `/spek:add-phase "Add admin dashboard"`

**`/spek:insert-phase <after> <description>`**
Insert urgent work as decimal phase between existing phases.

- Creates intermediate phase (e.g., 7.1 between 7 and 8)
- Useful for discovered work that must happen mid-milestone
- Maintains phase ordering

Usage: `/spek:insert-phase 7 "Fix critical auth bug"`
Result: Creates Phase 7.1

**`/spek:remove-phase <number>`**
Remove a future phase and renumber subsequent phases.

- Deletes phase directory and all references
- Renumbers all subsequent phases to close the gap
- Only works on future (unstarted) phases
- Git commit preserves historical record

Usage: `/spek:remove-phase 17`
Result: Phase 17 deleted, phases 18-20 become 17-19

### Milestone Management

**`/spek:new-milestone <name>`**
Start a new milestone through unified flow.

- Deep questioning to understand what you're building next
- Optional domain research (spawns 4 parallel researcher agents)
- Requirements definition with scoping
- Roadmap creation with phase breakdown

Mirrors `/spek:new-project` flow for brownfield projects (existing PROJECT.md).

Usage: `/spek:new-milestone "v2.0 Features"`

**`/spek:complete-milestone <version>`**
Archive completed milestone and prepare for next version.

- Creates MILESTONES.md entry with stats

### Debugging

**`/spek:debug [issue description]`**
Systematic debugging with persistent state across context resets.

- Gathers symptoms through adaptive questioning
- Creates `.planning/debug/[slug].md` to track investigation
- Investigates using scientific method (evidence → hypothesis → test)
- Survives `/clear` — run `/spek:debug` with no args to resume
- Archives resolved issues to `.planning/debug/resolved/`

Usage: `/spek:debug "login button doesn't work"`
Usage: `/spek:debug` (resume active session)

### Todo Management

**`/spek:add-todo [description]`**

## Workflow Modes

Set during `/spek:new-project`:

**Interactive Mode**

- Confirms each major decision
- Pauses at checkpoints for approval
- More guidance throughout

**YOLO Mode**

- Auto-approves most decisions
- Executes plans without confirmation
- Only stops for critical checkpoints

Change anytime by editing `.planning/config.json`

## Planning Configuration

Configure how planning artifacts are managed in `.planning/config.json`:

**`planning.commit_docs`** (default: `true`)
- `true`: Planning artifacts committed to git (standard workflow)
- `false`: Planning artifacts kept local-only, not committed

When `commit_docs: false`:
- Add `.planning/` to your `.gitignore`
- Useful for OSS contributions, client projects, or keeping planning private
- All planning files still work normally, just not tracked in git

**`planning.search_gitignored`** (default: `false`)
- `true`: Add `--no-ignore` to broad ripgrep searches
- Only needed when `.planning/` is gitignored and you want project-wide searches to include it

Example config:
```json
{
  "planning": {
    "commit_docs": false,
    "search_gitignored": true
  }
}
```

## Common Workflows

**Starting a new project:**

```
/spek:new-project        # Unified flow: questioning → research → requirements → roadmap
/clear
/spek:plan-phase 1       # Create plans for first phase
/clear
/spek:execute-phase 1    # Execute all plans in phase
```

**Resuming work after a break:**

```
/spek:progress  # See where you left off and continue
```

**Adding urgent mid-milestone work:**

```
/spek:insert-phase 5 "Critical security fix"
/spek:plan-phase 5.1
/spek:execute-phase 5.1
```

**Completing a milestone:**

```
/spek:complete-milestone 1.0.0
/clear
/spek:new-milestone  # Start next milestone (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)
```

**Capturing ideas during work:**

```
/spek:add-todo                    # Capture from conversation context
/spek:add-todo Fix modal z-index  # Capture with explicit description
/spek:check-todos                 # Review and work on todos
/spek:check-todos api             # Filter by area
```

**Debugging an issue:**

```
/spek:debug "form submission fails silently"  # Start debug session
# ... investigation happens, context fills up ...
/clear
/spek:debug                                    # Resume from where you left off
```

## Getting Help
